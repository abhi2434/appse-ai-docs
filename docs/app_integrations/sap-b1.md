### Select Authentication

When adding an SAP Business One credential, first choose your authentication type:

<img src="/img/credentials/sap-b1/select-authentication.png" width="700" alt="Select Authentication screen showing Service Layer (Cloud) and Service Layer (On-Premises Agent) options" />

SAP Business One Service Layer supports two authentication modes:

- **Service Layer (Cloud)** — connect directly to a cloud-accessible SAP B1 Service Layer
- **Service Layer (On-Premises Agent)** — connect through an active On-Prem Connector to SAP B1 Service Layer

Select your authentication type on the **Select Authentication** screen, then configure credentials as shown below.
